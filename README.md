# Project: Smooth CSS Transitions & Animations with JavaScript

Welcome to the **Smooth CSS Transitions & Animations** project! 🎉 This project is created to demonstrate how to add smooth CSS animations to elements like buttons or images and integrate JavaScript functions for dynamic behavior. The project also uses **localStorage** to store and retrieve user preferences for a more personalized experience.

## 🌟 Objectives

- **Create smooth CSS transitions and animations** to enhance the user experience.
- **Use JavaScript functions** to add dynamic behavior to the elements.
- **Implement localStorage** for storing data and making the app remember user preferences.

## 🛠️ Instructions

1. **CSS Animations**: Add smooth CSS animations to elements like buttons, images, or any interactive components to make them more engaging.
2. **JavaScript Functionality**: Write a JavaScript function that:
   - Stores and retrieves user preferences using **localStorage**.
   - Implements an animation triggered by user actions such as hover, click, or page load.

## 📝 Tasks

1. **Create a CSS Animation**: Design a smooth animation, such as a button that grows when hovered or an image that fades in on page load.
   
2. **Store Data in localStorage**: Write JavaScript code to store the user's preferences (like theme or animation settings) in **localStorage**, so the preferences persist even after the page is refreshed.

3. **Trigger Animations Dynamically**: Implement JavaScript to trigger animations based on user actions, such as clicking a button or interacting with elements on the page.

## 💡 Features

- **CSS Transitions & Animations**: Create visually appealing effects to enhance user interaction.
- **localStorage**: Save user preferences (e.g., theme) and apply them when the page is loaded again.
- **User-Triggered Animations**: Allow the user to trigger animations with clicks, hovers, or other actions.
